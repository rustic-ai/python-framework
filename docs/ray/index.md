# Ray Integration

This section contains documentation for RusticAI's Ray integration, which provides distributed execution capabilities for scalable agent systems.

## Overview

Ray is a unified framework for scaling AI and Python applications. The RusticAI Ray integration allows you to:

- Scale your agent systems across multiple machines
- Distribute agent workloads efficiently
- Manage resources adaptively based on demand
- Build high-performance, resilient multi-agent applications

## Features

- **Distributed Execution Engine** - Run agents across a Ray cluster
- **Resource Management** - Allocate CPU, GPU, and memory resources intelligently
- **Fault Tolerance** - Recover from node failures automatically
- **Dynamic Scaling** - Add or remove compute resources as needed

## Getting Started

To use the Ray integration, you'll need:

1. Ray installed in your environment
2. A Ray cluster (can be local or distributed)
3. RusticAI core framework configured properly

### Basic Example

```python
from rustic_ai.core.guild.builders import GuildBuilder
from rustic_ai.ray.execution_engine import RayExecutionEngine

# Configure a guild to use Ray for execution
guild_builder = GuildBuilder(guild_name="DistributedGuild") \
    .set_description("A guild using Ray for distributed execution") \
    .set_execution_engine("rustic_ai.ray.execution_engine.RayExecutionEngine") \
    .set_execution_engine_config({
        "address": "auto",  # Connect to existing Ray cluster
        "resources_per_agent": {"CPU": 1, "GPU": 0.1}
    })

# Add agents and launch
# ...
```
