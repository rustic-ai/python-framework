# RusticAI How-To Guides

Welcome to the RusticAI How-To Guides. These guides provide step-by-step instructions for common tasks when building systems with RusticAI. They are designed to complement the core documentation by focusing on practical implementation.

## Getting Started

- [Creating Your First Agent](creating_your_first_agent.md): Learn how to create a basic agent
- [Creating a Guild with Multiple Agents](creating_a_guild.md): Build a system with multiple interacting agents

## Core Capabilities

- [Managing State in Agents](state_management.md): Learn how to maintain and update state in your agents
- [Dependency Injection](dependency_injection.md): Provide external services to your agents
- [Testing Agents](testing_agents.md): Effectively test your agents in isolation
- [Writing Effective Agent Tests](writing_effective_agent_tests.md): In-depth guide with real-world testing patterns

## Reference

- [Agent Documentation](../agents/index.md): Detailed documentation of available agents in RusticAI

## Advanced Topics

These guides will be coming soon:

- Guild Specifications: Define complex guild configurations in JSON/YAML
- Custom Routing Strategies: Control message flow between agents
- Distributed Deployments: Run agents across multiple processes or machines
- Custom State Backends: Configure alternative state persistence mechanisms
- Performance Tuning: Optimize your agent system for throughput and latency

## Example Projects
