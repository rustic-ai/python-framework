# LiteLLM Agents

This section contains documentation for RusticAI's LiteLLM integration, which provides a unified interface to various large language models through the LiteLLM library.

## Available Agents

- [LiteLLMAgent](litellm_agent.md) - Interface to various LLMs through the LiteLLM library

## Overview

LiteLLM agents enable seamless integration with multiple language model providers through a single, consistent interface. The LiteLLM library abstracts away the differences between various LLM APIs (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, etc.), allowing you to switch between models with minimal code changes.

## Use Cases

- Natural language processing and generation
- Conversational AI systems
- Content creation and summarization
- Language translation and reformatting
- Knowledge extraction and question answering
- Multi-provider LLM implementation with easy fallbacks

## Getting Started

To use LiteLLM agents, you'll need:

1. API keys for your preferred LLM providers
2. LiteLLM library installed in your environment
3. Proper configuration of the LiteLLM agent in your guild

Refer to the [LiteLLMAgent](litellm_agent.md) documentation for detailed implementation instructions.
