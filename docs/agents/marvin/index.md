# Marvin Agents

This section contains documentation for RusticAI's Marvin integration, which provides classification and structured data extraction capabilities through the Prefect Marvin library.

## Available Agents

- [MarvinAgent](marvin_agent.md) - Classification and structured data extraction

## Overview

Marvin agents enable advanced text classification and structured data extraction within your RusticAI applications. Using Prefect's Marvin library, these agents can categorize text into predefined classes and extract structured information from unstructured text based on specified schemas.

## Use Cases

- Text classification and categorization
- Structured data extraction from text
- Intent recognition in natural language
- Information parsing and normalization
- Converting free-form text to structured formats
- Entity and attribute extraction

## Getting Started

To use Marvin agents, you'll need:

1. Marvin library installed in your environment
2. Proper configuration of the Marvin agent in your guild
3. Well-defined categories for classification or schemas for extraction

Refer to the [MarvinAgent](marvin_agent.md) documentation for detailed implementation instructions.
