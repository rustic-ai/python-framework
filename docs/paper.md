## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have paved the way for increasingly sophisticated applications. Among these, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) represent a powerful paradigm for tackling complex problems that are often beyond the capabilities of monolithic AI models. MAS involve multiple autonomous agents interacting within a shared environment, coordinating their actions to achieve common or individual goals.

### 1.2 Challenges in Multi-Agent System Development
Developing robust and scalable MAS presents several challenges:

- **Complexity**: Designing, implementing, and managing the interactions of numerous autonomous agents can be exceedingly complex.
- **Coordination**: Ensuring effective communication, collaboration, and conflict resolution among agents is non-trivial.
- **State Management**: Maintaining consistent state across distributed agents and long-running interactions requires careful design.
- **Integration**: Incorporating diverse AI models, tools, and data sources into a cohesive system can be difficult.
- **Scalability and Maintainability**: As systems grow, ensuring they remain scalable and maintainable is crucial.

### 1.3 Introducing RusticAI
RusticAI is a framework engineered to address these challenges head-on. Its primary mission is to streamline the exploration and practical application of MAS across diverse domains. By offering a structured, adaptable, and developer-friendly platform, RusticAI significantly simplifies the development, management, and deployment of complex agent-based systems.

### 1.4 Evolution of Agents, Multi-Agent Systems, and LLM-Powered Agents
The concept of autonomous agents and MAS has its roots in early AI research, aiming to solve intricate problems through distributed intelligence. Initially, agents ranged from simple reactive entities to more deliberative ones. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field, enabling the creation of highly capable, LLM-powered agents (e.g., AutoGPT, AgentGPT). These agents can perform complex reasoning, understand natural language, and generate human-like responses, drastically expanding the potential of MAS. RusticAI is designed to harness these advancements, providing a robust framework for integrating LLMs and other AI technologies into collaborative multi-agent ensembles.

### 1.5 RusticAI's Vision
RusticAI's vision is to empower developers and researchers to unlock the full potential of collective intelligence. We aim to provide a comprehensive yet flexible toolkit that accelerates innovation in autonomous AI, making the development of sophisticated multi-agent systems more accessible, manageable, and efficient.

## 2. Core Concepts of RusticAI

RusticAI is built upon a set of foundational concepts that define its architecture and operational paradigm.

### 2.1 Agents
In RusticAI, an **Agent** is a computational entity designed to achieve specific goals within an environment, which may include other agents. Key characteristics of RusticAI agents include:

- **Autonomy**: Agents can operate without constant human or system intervention, making decisions based on their perceived environment and internal state.
- **Perception**: Agents can perceive their environment through incoming messages and data streams.
- **Decision-Making**: Based on their programming and perceived information, agents make decisions to achieve their objectives.
- **Action**: Agents act upon their decisions, often by sending messages or interacting with external systems.
- **Specialization**: Agents are typically specialized to perform specific tasks or roles within a larger system (e.g., data retrieval, LLM interaction, user proxy).
- **Statefulness**: Agents can maintain internal state across interactions, allowing for memory and context awareness.

The spectrum of agents in RusticAI ranges from simple, rule-based components to advanced, adaptive entities that can learn and evolve their behavior. Each agent is defined by an **`AgentSpec`**, a declarative specification that outlines its class, properties, dependencies, and communication topics.

### 2.2 Guilds
The **Guild** is the cornerstone of RusticAI's architecture. A Guild is a logical grouping of agents that collaborate within a shared environment. It serves as a central hub for:

- **Organizing Agents**: Grouping functionally related agents into cohesive units to tackle specific tasks or workflows.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Controlling the registration, launching, execution, monitoring, and termination of its member agents.
- **Coordinated Execution**: Defining how agents run, leveraging various [Execution Engines](#522-execution-engines) (e.g., synchronous, asynchronous, distributed).
- **Message Orchestration**: Facilitating communication and defining sophisticated interaction patterns between agents through a powerful [Messaging System](#53-messaging-system) and routing rules.
- **Shared Resources**: Providing common [Dependencies](#55-dependency-injection) (like API clients or database connections) and [State Management](#54-state-management) facilities to its member agents.

A Guild is defined by a **`GuildSpec`**, a declarative blueprint typically specified in YAML or JSON, or constructed programmatically using the `GuildBuilder`. This specification details the guild's properties, its member agents (`AgentSpec` list), shared dependencies, and message routing logic.

### 2.3 Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in RusticAI
In RusticAI, a Multi-Agent System is realized through one or more Guilds. Each Guild acts as a self-contained MAS or a component of a larger, interconnected system. RusticAI's MAS approach emphasizes:

- **Decentralized Control**: While a Guild provides coordination, individual agents retain a degree of autonomy in their decision-making.
- **Collective Intelligence**: The system's overall intelligence and problem-solving capabilities emerge from the interactions and collaboration of its constituent agents.
- **Modularity**: Guilds and agents are modular components, allowing for flexible system design and composition.

### 2.4 Autonomous AI with RusticAI
RusticAI aims to facilitate the development of **Autonomous AI** systems. This encompasses individual agents and MAS capable of:

- **Self-Guided Operation**: Performing tasks and pursuing goals with minimal human intervention.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Adjusting strategies based on new information and changing environmental conditions.
- **Learning**: Incorporating mechanisms for agents and guilds to learn from experience and improve performance over time.
The framework provides the tools and abstractions necessary to build systems that exhibit varying degrees of autonomy, from human-supervised to fully autonomous operations.

## 3. RusticAI Architecture and Design

RusticAI's architecture is designed for modularity, flexibility, and scalability, enabling the construction of sophisticated multi-agent systems.

### 3.1 Modular Architecture
The framework is built around a core set of components primarily located within the `rustic_ai.core` package. These include modules for:

- **`messaging`**: Handles inter-agent communication.
- **`state`**: Manages agent and guild state.
- **`guild`**: Defines the guild structure, lifecycle, and execution.
- **`agents`**: Provides base classes and specifications for agents.
- **`utils`**: Contains common utilities and helper functions.
- **`ui_protocol`**: Defines standardized message formats for UI interaction.

This modularity offers significant benefits:

- **Isolation of Components**: Individual modules can be developed, tested, and updated independently.
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns simplifies understanding and maintaining the codebase.
- **Scalability**: The modular design facilitates scaling by allowing different components to be distributed or optimized as needed.
- **Ease of Modification and Extension**: New functionalities, agent types, or integrations can be added without disrupting existing components.

### 3.2 Guild-based Design

#### 3.2.1 Guild Lifecycle and Management
The lifecycle of a Guild in RusticAI involves several stages:

1. **Definition (`GuildSpec`)**: The Guild's structure is defined in a `GuildSpec`. This can be a YAML/JSON file or created programmatically using `GuildBuilder`, `AgentBuilder`, and `RouteBuilder`.
 ```python
 from rustic_ai.core.guild.builders import GuildBuilder, AgentBuilder
 # Example:
 # agent_spec = AgentBuilder(MyAgentClass).set_name("my_agent").build_spec()
 # guild_spec = GuildBuilder("MyGuild").add_agent_spec(agent_spec).build_spec()
 ```
2. **Instantiation and Launching Agents**:
 - **`GuildBuilder.launch()`**: For development and testing, this method creates a `Guild` instance and launches all its agents directly in the current environment.
 - **`GuildBuilder.bootstrap(metastore_database_url: str)`**: For production, this method creates a `Guild` instance and launches a `GuildManagerAgent`. This system agent persists the `GuildSpec` and manages the lifecycle of other agents, enabling more robust and potentially distributed deployments.
3. **Interaction**: Launched agents communicate via messages, orchestrated by the Guild's defined routes and messaging system.
4. **Shutdown**: `guild.shutdown()` is used for guilds launched via `launch()`. For bootstrapped guilds, shutdown is typically managed by the environment hosting the `GuildManagerAgent`.

#### 3.2.2 Execution Engines
Guilds utilize Execution Engines to manage how agents are run. RusticAI supports various modes, including:

- **Synchronous Execution**: Agents run sequentially, often used for debugging or simple workflows.
- **Multithreaded Execution**: Agents run in separate threads, allowing for concurrent operation.
- **Distributed Execution (e.g., via Ray)**: Agents can be distributed across multiple processes or machines for scalability.
The desired execution engine is typically specified in the `GuildSpec.properties`.

### 3.3 Messaging System
Effective communication is vital in MAS. RusticAI's messaging system provides:

- **MessageBus**: A foundational layer (often an in-memory queue or a more robust backend like Redis) that facilitates message exchange between agents.
- **Standardized Message Formats**: While agents can use custom Pydantic models for payloads, RusticAI also provides `ui_protocol` types for common interactions, especially with user interfaces. Each message includes sender, recipient, topic, and payload.
- **Publish/Subscribe**: Agents can publish messages to specific topics and subscribe to topics of interest.
- **RoutingSlips and RoutingRules**: A powerful mechanism within `GuildSpec` to define how messages are processed and forwarded. This allows for:
 - **Content-Based Routing**: Directing messages based on their content or type.
 - **Sequential Processing**: Defining multi-step workflows (A -> B -> C).
 - **Message Transformation**: Modifying message payloads between agents to ensure compatibility.
 - **Fan-out/Fan-in**: Distributing a message to multiple agents and potentially aggregating their responses.

### 3.4 State Management
RusticAI provides robust mechanisms for managing state at both the agent and guild levels:

- **Agent State**: Each agent can maintain its own internal state, which can persist across multiple interactions or its entire lifecycle.
- **Guild State**: Guilds can have shared state accessible to their member agents.
- **Persistence**: The framework allows for state to be persisted using various backends (e.g., in-memory, Redis, databases), ensuring data is not lost between sessions or in case of restarts. This is configured via Dependency Injection.

### 3.5 Dependency Injection
RusticAI features a sophisticated dependency injection system that simplifies the management of resources and services agents need:

- **`DependencySpec`**: Defines how a dependency (e.g., an API client, a database connection, a configuration object) should be resolved and instantiated.
- **Resolvers**: Custom classes that know how to create and provide instances of specific dependencies.
- **Guild-Level Dependencies**: Defined in `GuildSpec.dependency_map`, these are available to all agents within the guild.
- **Agent-Specific Dependencies**: Can be defined in `AgentSpec.dependency_map`, overriding guild-level dependencies if names conflict.
This system promotes loose coupling and makes agents more reusable and testable by decoupling them from the concrete implementation of their dependencies.

### 3.6 Extensibility and Integrations
RusticAI is designed for extensibility:

- **Plugin-Based System**: The architecture allows for easy integration of new agent types, execution engines, messaging backends, and dependency resolvers.
- **Rich Set of Integrations**: RusticAI comes with built-in support for a variety of popular AI tools and services, including:
 - **LLM Providers**: [LiteLLM](agents/litellm/index.md) for a unified interface to various LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, HuggingFace models, etc.).
 - **HuggingFace**: Direct integration with [HuggingFace models](agents/huggingface/index.md) for tasks like text generation (e.g., LLMPhiAgent), image generation (Stable Diffusion), image-to-image, speech-to-text, and NLP (SQuAD).
 - **Web Automation**: [PlaywrightScraperAgent](agents/playwright/index.md) for web scraping and browser automation.
 - **Web Search**: [SERPAgent](agents/serpapi/index.md) for accessing search engine results.
 - **AI Function Calling**: [MarvinAgent](agents/marvin/index.md) for structured data extraction and AI function calling.
 - **Distributed Computing**: [Ray](ray/index.md) for distributed and parallel execution of agents and guilds.
 - **Vector Databases**: [Chroma](dependencies/chroma/index.md) for semantic search and document indexing (e.g., used by `VectorAgent`).
 - **Key-Value Stores**: [Redis](dependencies/redis/index.md) for fast state management and messaging backends.
 - **Language Model Utilities**: [LangChain](dependencies/langchain/index.md) components for text splitting, embeddings, etc.

## 4. Key Features and Capabilities

**Guild Composition & System Architecture**:

- **`UserProxyAgent`**: Interface for fraud analysts to interact with the system, review alerts, and provide feedback.
- **`LiteLLMAgent` (or specialized NLP agent)**: To analyze textual data associated with transactions or alerts, generate summaries for analysts.
- **`PlaywrightScraperAgent` / `SERPAgent` (as External Data Agents - EDA)**: To fetch external information (e.g., checking blacklists, verifying merchant details).
- **Custom Anomaly Detection Agent (TMA/HAA/UBA combined)**: A core agent implementing machine learning models to:
 - Monitor transactions in real-time (TMA functionality).
 - Analyze historical transaction data for patterns linked to fraud (HAA functionality).
 - Analyze user behavior to detect unusual activities (UBA functionality). This agent might use dependencies like a vector database or a feature store.
- **Response Agent (RA)**: An agent that takes action upon confirmed fraud detection (e.g., sends alerts, triggers account suspension via an API call).
- **`GuildManagerAgent`**: (If deployed in a production setup) Manages the lifecycle of the fraud detection guild.
- **Shared Dependencies**: Connections to transaction databases, customer databases, fraud model registries, alert systems.

**Operational Flow**:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Transaction data streams into the Anomaly Detection Agent.
2. **Real-Time Analysis**: The Anomaly Detection Agent scrutinizes each transaction against risk models, historical patterns, and user behavior baselines. EDAs provide supplementary external data.
3. **Alert Generation**: Suspicious transactions are flagged, and alerts are generated. The LLM Agent might enrich these alerts with contextual information.
4. **Analyst Review**: Alerts are routed to the `UserProxyAgent` for human review. Analysts investigate and confirm or dismiss fraud.
5. **Response Execution**: If fraud is confirmed, the `UserProxyAgent` (or an automated rule) instructs the Response Agent to take appropriate action.
6. **Continuous Learning**: Analyst feedback and new fraud patterns are used to retrain and refine the Anomaly Detection Agent's models.

**Benefits**: Real-time detection, scalability to handle high transaction volumes, adaptability through model updates, holistic analysis by integrating diverse data, and cost-effectiveness through automation.
