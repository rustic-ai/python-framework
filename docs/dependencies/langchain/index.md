# LangChain Dependencies

The LangChain package provides dependency resolvers that integrate the LangChain framework into RusticAI agents. LangChain is a popular framework for developing applications powered by language models.

## Available Resolvers

- [OpenAIEmbeddingsResolver](openai_embeddings.md) - Generate vector embeddings using OpenAI's embedding models
- [CharacterSplitterResolver](character_splitter.md) - Text splitter based on characters with configurable chunk size
- [RecursiveSplitterResolver](recursive_splitter.md) - Text splitter that recursively splits by different separators

## Usage

LangChain dependencies provide essential tools for working with text data, from embedding generation to text chunking. These capabilities are especially useful for natural language processing tasks and for preparing data for vector databases and retrieval systems.

For details on how to configure and use each resolver, please refer to the specific documentation links above.
