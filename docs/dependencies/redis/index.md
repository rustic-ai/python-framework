# Redis Dependencies

The Redis package provides dependency resolvers that integrate Redis services with RusticAI agents. Redis is a popular in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker.

## Available Resolvers

- [RedisKVStoreResolver](redis_kvstore.md) - Persistent key-value store backed by Redis

## Usage

Redis dependencies offer persistence and cross-process sharing capabilities that are essential for distributed and production deployments. These resolvers provide the persistence of a database with the performance of an in-memory solution.

For details on how to configure and use each resolver, please refer to the specific documentation links above.
