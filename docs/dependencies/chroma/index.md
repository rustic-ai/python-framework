# Chroma Dependencies

The Chroma package provides dependency resolvers that integrate the Chroma vector database into RusticAI agents. Chroma is a lightweight, open-source vector database for storing and searching embeddings.

## Available Resolvers

- [ChromaResolver](chroma_resolver.md) - Vector database for storing, managing, and searching embeddings

## Usage

Chroma dependencies enable agents to perform vector-based operations like semantic search, similarity matching, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). These capabilities are essential for building agents that can work with unstructured data and provide contextually relevant responses.

For details on how to configure and use each resolver, please refer to the specific documentation links above.
